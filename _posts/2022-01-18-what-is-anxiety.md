Anxiety is now the leading mental health problem around the world, and the incidence of anxiety is still rising.

Anxiety is our body’s natural response to danger, whether real or imagined. It is a feeling of fear or apprehension, a sense of dread about what is to come in the future.

We will all experience feelings of anxiety at some point in our lives, it’s very common to feel tense or unsure about a potentially stressful situation, such as an exam, starting a new job, or moving home. However, some of us will be affected more than others. Despite being a normal experience, if these feelings are very strong or are long lasting, they can become overwhelming and start to constrict our lives and become a chronic condition. The feeling of fear may be with you all the time, and can be intense and sometimes debilitating. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes, but does not interfere with your everyday life.
