Online therapy is not suitable for people in acute distress or crisis. Whilst online therapists can work with people who are self-harming or who are feeling suicidal, those people who have begun to make a plan to complete suicide, who are currently attempting to complete suicide or who have attempted to complete suicide in the last 4 weeks, are not suitable to work with a therapist online. This is because when working online your therapist does not have access to the same local resources to help keep you safe.
